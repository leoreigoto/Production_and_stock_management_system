<b>Objective</b>

Create a system that uses queue and deque structures to manage a factory and automate the creation of manufacturing orders based on branches stocks levels. The ideia its that this system could be used alongside readings from systems like RFID as a middleware before sending the data to an ERP. This would be an open-source replacement to RFID suppliers middlewares and would be highly scalable and easy to personalize with new funcionalities for each specific business (ie: on the proejct is implemented the system to generate manufacturing orders based on stock levels and management of production station queues)

<b>Technologies and Tools</b>
